# Tandem Trivia

_An interpretation by [Kirk Sudduth](https://github.com/kirksudduth "This was fun! Thanks for the opportunity!")_

## Proposal

> I am ecstatic about getting the chance to land an apprenticship at Tandem! I felt the best way for me to write this Trivia program was in Python as a CLI application.

## Project Criteria

> - a round of trivia has 10 questions
> - all multiple choice
> - user can view questions
> - questions w/ answers displayed one at a time
> - user can only select one answer
> - correct answer must be revealed after user has submitted their answer
> - user can see their score at the end of the round

## Setup

1.  Enter local Terminal directory where you would like the project to live
1.  Run `git clone https://github.com/kirksudduth/kirk_sudduth_tandem_trivia.git`
1.  Run `python index.py`
1.  Enjoy the trivia!

## Tests

- In your `tandem_trivia` directory run the `python -m unittest` command to run the two tests I incorporated into the program
- The two initial tests check that all answers were getting added correctly to the answers list so they could be shuffled and iterated over to provide options for user.
- The third test checks to make sure the list of answers is printed correctly in the terminal

## Thanks

> Big thank you to Tandem for allowing me this opportunity! _Especially_ big thank you to **YOU** for reading this!
