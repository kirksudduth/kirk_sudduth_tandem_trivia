# Tandem Trivia

_An interpretation by [Kirk Sudduth](https://github.com/kirksudduth "This was fun! Thanks for the opportunity!")_

## Proposal

> I am ecstatic about getting the chance to land an apprenticship at Tandem! I felt the best way for me to write this Trivia program was in Python as a CLI application.

## Project Criteria

> - a round of trivia has 10 questions
> - all multiple choice
> - user can view questions
> - questions w/ answers displayed one at a time
> - user can only select one answer
> - correct answer must be revealed after user has submitted their answer
> - user can see their score at the end of the round

## Setup

1.  Enter local Terminal directory where you would like project stored
1.  Run `git clone https://github.com/kirksudduth/kirk_sudduth_tandem_trivia.git`
1.  Run `python index.py`
1.  Enjoy the trivia!

## Thanks
